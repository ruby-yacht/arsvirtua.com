<p>Ars Virtua Artist-in-Residence</p>
<p>Call for Proposals<br />
  Orwell Residence, Minecraft<br />
  Deadline: April 28, 2014</p>
<p>Artist, coders, poets, and engineers are invited to apply for a six week artist residency in the virtual environment / game space of Minecraft. Minecraft is a sandbox where creativity and ludology intersect in a highly social space rich with possibilities due to relative openness of the code and hosting options.</p>
<p>Ars Virtua is soliciting proposals for its Artist-in-Residence program (AVAIR). Established and emerging artists are invited to participate. The residency will culminate in an exhibition and opening in Minecraft and documentation in Minecraft and on the web. Depending on the nature of the exhibition a downloadable &quot;world&quot; may also be made available. Residents will also receive a $400 stipend, training and mentorship as necessary.</p>
<p>AVAIR is an extended performance that examines what it means to reside in a place that has no physical location. The purpose of the residency is to reflect on the nature of the game environment and terrestrial world in the context of contemporary art. NO Previous experience in virtual environments or Minecraft is necessary.</p>
<p>Ars Virtua is very aware of the power of virtual worlds. The arts continue to shape our understanding of technologies, this residency targets both game-spaces and virtual environments as a place for emergent art, performance art, coded art and social experimentation. It is the purpose of this residency to give direct attention to the interrogation of the space, place, and metaphor.  Residents will be encouraged to explore, experiment with and challenge traditional conventions of art making and distribution, value and the art market, artist and audience, space and place, data and reality.</p>
<p>The residency will take place in Orwell on our semi-private server and in our building space. Potential residents are welcome to visit beforehand.</p>
<p>Our previous residence project can be seen <a href="http://vimeo.com/87924918">here</a>.</p>
<p>Application Process:</p>
<p>Artists are encouraged to become familiar with Minecraft before applying. Be aware that there is a limited free trial. Applications will be judged based on ideas presented and work previously executed. We are looking for an artist who is willing to work within what may be a new environment for them and be prepared to evolve in response to the malleable world that is Minecraft.</p>
<p>To apply send the following information to avair-at-arsvirtua.com:<br />
  1) Name, address, phone number, email address.<br />
  2) A brief statement about what interests you about Minecraft or what you might like to explore.<br />
  3) Link to an online portfolio (expect a 5 minute visit). If you do not have an online portfolio please briefly discuss your work. <br />
  4) One page proposal.  Note that the proposal is NOT a commitment, but expresses your interest.</p>
<p>Applications are due on or before Monday April 28, please send any inquiries or additional questions to avair-at-arsvirtua.com. </p>

						Ars Virtua is a new media center and gallery located in the synthetic world of Second Life. It is a new type of space that leverages the tension between 3-D rendered game space and terrestrial reality, between simulated and simulation. Ars Virtua is sponsored by the CADRE Laboratory for New Media.

						<li>Borders define geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, states or sub-national administrative divisions.<br />
							<br />
						</li>
						<li>The boundary of a set (in mathematics) is those points that can be approached from within the set and without. It is all points not contained in the interior of a set.<br />
							<br />
						</li>
						<li>The liminal state (in ritual) is characterized by ambiguity, openness, and indeterminacy. One's sense of identity dissolves to some extent, bringing about disorientation. Liminality is a period of transition, during which normal limits to thought, self- understanding, and behavior are relaxed, opening the way to something new.</li>

					Borders are frequently under contention; they are regions that neatly separate two entities and enable a form of deconstruction. However, the distinctions formed by borders are not sufficient and we realize that often the border begins to represent a third region and generates more contentious borders.<br />
					<br />
					It is truly difficult to discern the breadth a border, an indeterminate space, and it's depth is dependent on the sphere, there is a point when you can cross into the &quot;other.&quot; Borders would be impossible to cross if this was false and the liminal space would disappear.<br />
					<br />
					It is our assertion that the synthetic world is a fundamentally liminal space. This is not because it is functionally transitional, except perhaps that it is not a destination, but that it functions parallel to 'real' space and remains temporary in its occupancy.<br />
					<br />
					Our interest lies in both the synthetic and the terrestrial world though fundamentally one is a subset of the other. A Venn diagram may hold visual information about this relationship, but it misses the point. There is a functional liminal space that exists outside the terrestrial. We want to emphasize that while there is a relationship here the liminal space that is created synthetically doesn't exist in a terrestrial sense. So the atoms and the electrons are terrestrial and represented by our friend Venn, the intellectual space is not however anything but contained by materials and represents a different space.<br />
					<br />
					To that end we are considering sessions relating to gender/sexuality, race, architecture, body/technology, body/digital image, life/non- life, transgenics, and game/environment. If you have an interest in these topics and would like to present, or would like to suggest another topic please contact <a href="mailto:nmc@arsvirtua.com">nmc@arsvirtua.com</a><br />

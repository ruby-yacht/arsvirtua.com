<h3>About Ars Virtua</h3>
<br />
Ars Virtua is a New Media Center and Gallery located primarily in the synthetic world of Second Life. Located in Dowden and Seventh Eye, Ars Virtua has created both a  &quot;permanent&quot; exhibition space and a place for rotating exhibits. With a 4000 meter two story permanent collection in Dowden and a total of 24000 meters between all our locations, Ars Virtua facilitates exploratory ventures in synthetic worlds. The Ars Virtua Artist in Residence (<a href="residence.html">AVAIR</a>) which supports artists both in Second Life and World of Warcraft expands beyond Second Life to include the most popular fantasy game played online in the US.  Ars Virtua is committed to research and furthering the dialogue around synthetic worlds, the 3D web and the creation of native art in new mediums.<br />

	<p>Second Life is a 3D online persistent space totally created and evolved by its users. Within this vast and rapidly expanding place, you can do, create or become just about anything you can imagine. Built-in content creation tools let you make almost anything you can imagine, in real time and in collaboration with others. An incredibly detailed digital body ('Avatar') allows a rich and customizable identity. A physics simulation running on a backbone of numerous connected computers allows you to be immersed in a visceral, interactive world. The ability to design and resell 3D content, combined with the ability to own and develop land and a microcurrency, which can be exchanged to real money creates a fertile new world for artistic exploration.</p>

<div>Mission Statement</div>

<div class="text">
Ars Virtua is a new media center and gallery located entirely in the synthetic world of Second Life. It is a new type of space that leverages the tension between 3-D rendered game space and terrestrial reality, between simulated and simulation. Ars Virtua is a venue for new genres; it is also a platform for showcasing traditional artists creating still and moving images, for instance, who apply scripts to extend these into the synthetic game environment. Ars Virtua maintains a close relationship with the underlying animation engine that enables Second Life architecture and 3D rendered "sculpture." Ars Virtua brings the art audience into "new media" rather than new media to the museum or gallery, and calls upon its audience to interact with the art and one another via their avatars within the space.

<div class="title">Goals</div>

<div class="text">
<ul>
<li>To enhance the public's understanding of constructed/synthetic worlds, how they are similar and how they differ from our own world</li>
<br />
<li>To develop the medium for art production, and to be a laboratory for the formation of new art practices</li>
<br />
<li>To provide a platform for the intersection of media and the information/knowledge fields</li>
<br />
<li>To promote the development of a commons in networked space, a place where ideas can be exchanged across physical borders inside a shared experiential space</li>
</ul>

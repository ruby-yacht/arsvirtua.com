<p>/hug (prounounced &quot;slash hug&quot; is a non-governmental organization which provides essential aid to the most needy in Azeroth regardless of race, faction, class or guild.</p>
<p>we are guided by the following principles:</p>

<p>humanity -   /hug, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavors, in its inter-factional and inter-kingdom capacity, to prevent and alleviate humanoid suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the humanoid. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all races.</p>
<p>impartiality -  /hug makes no discrimination as to race, religious beliefs, or class. It endeavors to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.</p>
<p>neutrality - In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies relating to faction, reputation, religion, race or looting practices.</p>
<p>independence - The movement is independent. The realm societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective kingdoms, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the movement.</p>
<p>voluntary service - It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for experience, gear or achievements.</p>
<p>universality - The International /hug Movement is across all regional variations.  All /hug societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other.</p>

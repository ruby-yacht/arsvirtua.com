Jenene Castle is a New Media Artist currently  studying at the CADRE
Laboratory in Silicon Valley. Having sparked an interest in sociological work,
her artistic approach revolves around the conceptual ideas of what
interactivity, mixed reality, performance, and video art can do to create a
dialog with the participants. Her recent works, "Trading Voices" presented at
the 2010 01SJ Biennial and "/hug" presented at the Laguna Art Museum in 2009
both address the ideas of how social activism can be created and represented
through art. Within her academics, Castle serves as the Assistant Editor of
SWITCH Journal for New Media, which strives to unite the Art and Technology
communities. At ISEA 2011, Jenene is working collaboratively with the Third
Faction to present Demand Player Sovereignty (DPS) which aims to pioneer the

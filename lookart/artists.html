<p>Thomas Asmuth - &quot;Anything that calls attention to and interests the viewer in this physicality is a deterrent to our understanding of the idea and is used as an expressive device. The conceptual artist would want to ameliorate this emphasis on materiality as much as possible or to use it in a paradoxical way (to convert it into an idea). This kind of art, then, should be stated with the greatest economy of means. Any idea that is better stated in two dimensions should not be in three dimensions. Ideas may also be stated with numbers, photographs, or words or any way the artist chooses, the form being unimportant.&quot;</p>
<p>I propose to mount representational and abstract paintings on the walls of the Look Art MUD through text based instruction sets. All works with adhere to a grid system and will contain an instruction set. Per the users impulse one could execute the works with materials as simple as graph paper and color pencils in order to experience the construction and perception of an optical artifact. Just like LeWitt's instructional works of art, the works will be for sale per the strict guidelines in the instruction set and contract that covers the materials, workmanship, and ownership. This would allow the collector to execute a genuine Thomas Asmuth optical artifact. I agree to give a 20% commission to Turbulence.org for any sales that might occur during the run of the show.</p>
<p>Alejandro Duque - TRUeQUE/M00</p>
<p>The main goal will be to create a space where characters can meet to exchange various tyoe of data and information (by the way of an encapsulated transmition within the TyniMux platform). A space that server as a meeting point but is also a protocol that will allow us to interface via OSC (OpenSoundControl) with the physical world. So if I create an object inside the MOO then it will be possible to hook it to sound synths or micro-controllers outside the virtrual world.</p>
<p>It will be then a 2 parts project:</p>
<p>1. Build a space and a set of objects that conform to some pynchonesque dystopian present where we will operate. (based on MUSH code)</p>
<p>2. hijack the MUSH code snippets to create such a protocol that will allow us to pipe and encapsulated packets from the atomic world into the MUD and viceversa.</p>
<p>A friend codes a synth that we control over IRC. It will be possible to integrate it to the above equation so if one runs the tinymux client along with his sound engine we will be able to perform the sounds of the space we are inmersed into.</p>
<p>links to completed works that might contextualize the proposal<br />
Briefly consider these questions:</p>
<p>TRUeQUE stands for:<br />
TranscommRoutes for Un-Expected Queued Events<br />
It is an ongoing project expanded after my research at locusonus.org</p>

<p>Christopher Poff - The notion behind Art.Meaning is to create a functional, interactive version of an artist manifesto that as originally written as creative prose as if it were the transcript for a text adventure game. It takes the abstract concepts of &quot;art,&quot; &quot;artist,&quot; &quot;meaning,&quot; &quot;purpose&quot; and other qualities of the process of artistic expression and present them philosophically as virtual objects in the MUX environment. The work will essentially function as an essay on art which has been encoded into a virtual &quot;game&quot; environment. The original text of the manifesto can be found at: http://www.uwm.edu/~cmpoff/Art.Meaning.txt</p>
